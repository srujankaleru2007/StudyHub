# 🚀 Quick Start - Push to GitHub & Deploy

## ✅ Step 1: Configure Git (Run these commands in terminal)

Open PowerShell/Command Prompt in your project folder and run:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

**Replace with your actual name and email!**

## ✅ Step 2: Files are Already Staged

I've already run `git add .` for you! 

---

## 📝 Step 3: Commit (Run this command)

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit - StudyHub premium productivity app"
```

---

## 🌐 Step 4: Create GitHub Repository

### Go to GitHub:
1. Visit [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the **"+"** icon → **"New repository"**
3. Name: `StudyHub` (or your choice)
4. Make it **Public**
5. **DON'T** check "Initialize with README"
6. Click **"Create repository"**

---

## 🔗 Step 5: Connect & Push (Run these commands)

After creating the repo, GitHub will show you commands. Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/StudyHub.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Example:**
If your username is `srujan`, the command would be:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/srujan/StudyHub.git
git push -u origin main
```

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Sign up/login with GitHub
3. Click **"New Project"**
4. Select your **StudyHub** repository
